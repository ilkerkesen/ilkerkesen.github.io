I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Ko√ß University, KUIS AI Center](https://ai.ku.edu.tr), under the supervision of [Deniz Yuret](https://www.denizyuret.com). My main research area is natural language processing and my recent research focus is on vision-language problems, multimodal learning and commonsense reasoning. Previously, I received my bachelor degree from [Istanbul Technical University](https://www.itu.edu.tr), [Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering](https://ehb.itu.edu.tr/en/home). The easiest way to contact me is to [send an email](mailto:ikesen16--ku.edu.tr).
